Version 1.3-2
 
   o Fix main package help page (request of Kurt Hornik).
   
Version 1.3-1

   o Provide dialog box for tests and diagostic plots of proportional hazards allowing for terms as well as coefficients (as result of comment by Tan Chuen Seng); modify testPropHazards() accordingly.

Version 1.3-0

   o Use Rcmdr R Markdown headers.
   
   o Reorganize computation of diagnostics.
   
   o Small bug fixes.

Version 1.2-2

   o Corrected ZPH plots to check proportional hazards for models with terms with > 1 df, reflecting a change to survival::cox.zph() (problem reported by Susan Hilsenbeck).
   
   o Updated JSS citations to use DOI.

Version 1.2-1

   o Corrected legend in graph of Survfit() survival functions with multiple strata variables (reported by Susan Hilsenbeck).

Version 1.2-0

   o Uses new model-handling features in Rcmdr 2.4-0.
   
   o Small fix to unfold() to handle correctly (again) time-varying covariates with specified times.

Version 1.1-1

   o Updated Russian translation (thanks to Anton Korobeynikov).

Version 1.1-0

    o  Use tabbed dialogs and other Rcmdr enhancements
    
    o  Correct specification of survival type is Cox model and parametric survival regression dialogs.
    
    o  Allow factors as event type to accommodate multistate outcomes.
    
    o  New Slovenian translation, courtesy of Matjaz Jeran.
    
    o  Updated Spanish translation (thanks to Manuel Munoz Marquez).
